# machine-learning-playground

Experiments with machine learning and AI algorithms, write guides, and documents.

## Getting Started

This project has multiple sub-projects. Each sub-project has its own README file. Please refer to the README file of the sub-project you are interested in.

### Prerequisites

All projects are written in Python. You need to have Python installed on your machine to run the projects.

### Installing

each project has its own requirements. You can install them with pip. I did not give specific versions for the libraries to not mess up with your current environment. You can check the tested versions in the README file of the sub-project you are interested in.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: My Python version is 3.8.4. You may need to install the required libraries with the appropriate version.
