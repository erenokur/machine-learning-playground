# pattern_classification_error_rate

Pattern classification error rate provides a way to quantify the performance of a classification model. A lower error rate indicates that the model is more accurate in its predictions. It's a valuable metric for evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms used for tasks like spam filtering, image recognition, or sentiment analysis.

This is a simple implementation of the error rate of a pattern classification system.
The error rate is calculated by the formula:

$$Eclass(h, S') = \frac{1}{|S'|} \sum_{(x, z) \in S'} (1[h(x) \neq z]) $$

Explanation of the terms:

    Eclass(h, S'): This term denotes the expected classification error of the hypothesis class h evaluated on the set S′. It essentially calculates the average probability that h will misclassify a sample drawn from S′.

    h(x): This represents the predicted class label assigned by the hypothesis h to a specific input sample x. In simpler terms, it's what category h predicts x belongs to.

    z: This signifies the actual class label of the sample (x,z). It represents the true category that the sample x belongs to.

    (x, z): This represents a single sample drawn from the set S′. It's a pair where x is the input value and z is its corresponding true class label.

    Σ: This is the summation symbol. It indicates that we are summing a value over all possible samples (x,z) that belong to the set S′.

    |S'|: This represents the cardinality of the set S′, which essentially means the total number of elements (samples) in the set.

    1[h(x) != z]: This part utilizes the indicator function. It takes a value of 1 if the predicted class label h(x) is not equal to the actual class label z (i.e., a misclassification occurred), and 0 otherwise (correct classification).

How it Works:

    Iterate through all samples in the set (S').

    For each sample, the indicator function checks if the model's prediction (h(x)) matches the actual label (z).

    If there's a mismatch (prediction ≠ actual label), the indicator function contributes a value of 1 to the sum.

    If the prediction is correct, the indicator function contributes 0.

    Finally, divide the sum by the total number of samples in (S') to get the average value. This average represents the overall error rate (proportion of misclassified samples) for the model on the data set.
